## Introduction

Software engineering principles, from Robert C. Martin's book
[*Clean Code*](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882),
adapted for Python. This is not a style guide. It's a guide to producing
readable, reusable, and refactorable software in Python.

Not every principle herein has to be strictly followed, and even fewer will be universally 
agreed upon. These are guidelines and nothing more, but they are ones codified over many 
years of collective experience by the authors of *Clean Code*.

Inspired from [clean-code-javascript](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript)

Targets Python3.7+

## **Variables**
### Use meaningful and pronounceable variable names

**Bad:**
```python
ymdstr = datetime.date.today().strftime("%y-%m-%d")
```

**Good**:
```python
current_date: str = datetime.date.today().strftime("%y-%m-%d")
```

### Use the same vocabulary for the same type of variable

**Bad:**
Here we use three different names for the same underlying entity:
```python
get_user_info()
get_client_data()
get_customer_record()
```

**Good**:
If the entity is the same, you should be consistent in referring to it in your functions:
```python
get_user_info()
get_user_data()
get_user_record()
```

**Even better**
Python is (also) an object oriented programming language. If it makes sense, package the functions together with the concrete implementation
of the entity in your code, as instance attributes, property methods, or methods:

```python
class User:
    info : str

    @property
    def data(self) -> dict:
        # ...

    def get_record(self) -> Union[Record, None]:
        # ...
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Use searchable names
We will read more code than we will ever write. It's important that the code we do write is 
readable and searchable. By *not* naming variables that end up being meaningful for 
understanding our program, we hurt our readers.
Make your names searchable.

**Bad:**
```python
# What the heck is 86400 for?
time.sleep(86400);
```

**Good**:
```python
# Declare them in the global namespace for the module.
SECONDS_IN_A_DAY = 60 * 60 * 24

time.sleep(SECONDS_IN_A_DAY)
```
**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Use explanatory variables
**Bad:**
```python
address = 'One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014'
city_zip_code_regex = r'^[^,\\]+[,\\\s]+(.+?)\s*(\d{5})?$'
matches = re.match(city_zip_code_regex, address)

save_city_zip_code(matches[1], matches[2])
```

**Not bad**:

It's better, but we are still heavily dependent on regex.

```python
address = 'One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014'
city_zip_code_regex = r'^[^,\\]+[,\\\s]+(.+?)\s*(\d{5})?$'
matches = re.match(city_zip_code_regex, address)

city, zip_code = matches.groups()
save_city_zip_code(city, zip_code)
```

**Good**:

Decrease dependence on regex by naming subpatterns.
```python
address = 'One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014'
city_zip_code_regex = r'^[^,\\]+[,\\\s]+(?P<city>.+?)\s*(?P<zip_code>\d{5})?$'
matches = re.match(city_zip_code_regex, address)

save_city_zip_code(matches['city'], matches['zip_code'])
```

### Avoid Mental Mapping
Don’t force the reader of your code to translate what the variable means.
Explicit is better than implicit.

**Bad:**
```python
seq = ('Austin', 'New York', 'San Francisco')

for item in seq:
    do_stuff()
    do_some_other_stuff()
    # ...
    # Wait, what's `item` for again?
    dispatch(item)
```

**Good**:
```python
locations = ('Austin', 'New York', 'San Francisco')

for location in locations:
    do_stuff()
    do_some_other_stuff()
    # ...
    dispatch(location)
```

### Don't add unneeded context

If your class/object name tells you something, don't repeat that in your
variable name.

**Bad:**

```python
class Car:
    car_make: str
    car_model: str
    car_color: str
```

**Good**:

```python
class Car:
    make: str
    model: str
    color: str
```

### Use default arguments instead of short circuiting or conditionals

**Tricky**

Why write:

```python
def create_micro_brewery(name):
    name = "Hipster Brew Co." if name is None else name
    slug = hashlib.sha1(name.encode()).hexdigest()
    # etc.
```

... when you can specify a default argument instead? This also makes ist clear that
you are expecting a string as the argument.

**Good**:

```python
def create_micro_brewery(name: str="Hipster Brew Co."):
    slug = hashlib.sha1(name.encode()).hexdigest()
    # etc.
```

## **Functions**
### Function arguments (2 or fewer ideally)
Limiting the amount of function parameters is incredibly important because it makes 
testing your function easier. Having more than three leads to a combinatorial explosion 
where you have to test tons of different cases with each separate argument.

Zero arguments is the ideal case. One or two arguments is ok, and three should be avoided. 
Anything more than that should be consolidated. Usually, if you have more than two 
arguments then your function is trying to do too much. In cases where it's not, most 
of the time a higher-level object will suffice as an argument.

**Bad:**
```python
def create_menu(title, body, button_text, cancellable):
    # ...
```

**Good**:
```python
class Menu:
    def __init__(self, config: dict):
        title = config["title"]
        body = config["body"]
        # ...

menu = Menu(
    {
        "title": "My Menu",
        "body": "Something about my menu",
        "button_text": "OK",
        "cancellable": False
    }
)
```

**Also good**
```python
class MenuConfig:
    """A configuration for the Menu.

    Attributes:
        title: The title of the Menu.
        body: The body of the Menu.
        button_text: The text for the button label.
        cancellable: Can it be cancelled?
    """
    title: str
    body: str
    button_text: str
    cancellable: bool = False


def create_menu(config: MenuConfig):
    title = config.title
    body = config.body
    # ...


config = MenuConfig
config.title = "My delicious menu"
config.body = "A description of the various items on the menu"
config.button_text = "Order now!"
# The instance attribute overrides the default class attribute.
config.cancellable = True

create_menu(config)
```

**Fancy**
```python
from typing import NamedTuple


class MenuConfig(NamedTuple):
    """A configuration for the Menu.

    Attributes:
        title: The title of the Menu.
        body: The body of the Menu.
        button_text: The text for the button label.
        cancellable: Can it be cancelled?
    """
    title: str
    body: str
    button_text: str
    cancellable: bool = False


def create_menu(config: MenuConfig):
    title, body, button_text, cancellable = config
    # ...


create_menu(
    MenuConfig(
        title="My delicious menu",
        body="A description of the various items on the menu",
        button_text="Order now!"
    )
)
```

**Even fancier**
```python
from dataclasses import astuple, dataclass


@dataclass
class MenuConfig:
    """A configuration for the Menu.

    Attributes:
        title: The title of the Menu.
        body: The body of the Menu.
        button_text: The text for the button label.
        cancellable: Can it be cancelled?
    """
    title: str
    body: str
    button_text: str
    cancellable: bool = False

def create_menu(config: MenuConfig):
    title, body, button_text, cancellable = astuple(config)
    # ...


create_menu(
    MenuConfig(
        title="My delicious menu",
        body="A description of the various items on the menu",
        button_text="Order now!"
    )
)
```

### Functions should do one thing
This is by far the most important rule in software engineering. When functions do more 
than one thing, they are harder to compose, test, and reason about. When you can isolate 
a function to just one action, they can be refactored easily and your code will read much 
cleaner. If you take nothing else away from this guide other than this, you'll be ahead 
of many developers.

**Bad:**
```python

def email_clients(clients: List[Client]):
    """Filter active clients and send them an email.
    """
    for client in clients:
        if client.active:
            email(client)
```

**Good**:
```python
def get_active_clients(clients: List[Client]) -> List[Client]:
    """Filter active clients.
    """
    return [client for client in clients if client.active]


def email_clients(clients: List[Client, ...]) -> None:
    """Send an email to a given list of clients.
    """
    for client in clients:
        email(client)
```

Do you see an opportunity for using generators now?

**Even better**
```python
def active_clients(clients: List[Client]) -> Generator[Client]:
    """Only active clients.
    """
    return (client for client in clients if client.active)


def email_client(clients: Iterator[Client]) -> None:
    """Send an email to a given list of clients.
    """
    for client in clients:
        email(client)
```

### Function names should say what they do

**Bad:**

```python
class Email:
    def handle(self) -> None:
        # Do something...

message = Email()
# What is this supposed to do again?
message.handle()
```

**Good:**

```python
class Email:
    def send(self) -> None:
        """Send this message.
        """

message = Email()
message.send()
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Functions should only be one level of abstraction

When you have more than one level of abstraction, your function is usually doing too 
much. Splitting up functions leads to reusability and easier testing.

**Bad:**

```python
def parse_better_js_alternative(code: str) -> None:
    regexes = [
        # ...
    ]

    statements = regexes.split()
    tokens = []
    for regex in regexes:
        for statement in statements:
            # ...

    ast = []
    for token in tokens:
        # Lex.

    for node in ast:
        # Parse.
```

**Good:**

```python
def parse_better_js_alternative(code: str) -> None:
    tokens = tokenize(code)
    syntax_tree = parse(tokens)

    for node in syntax_tree:
        # Parse.


def tokenize(code: str) -> list:
    REGEXES = [
        # ...
    ]

    statements = code.split()
    tokens = []
    for regex in REGEXES:
        for statement in statements:
           # Append the statement to tokens.

    return tokens


def parse(tokens: list) -> list:
    syntax_tree = []
    for token in tokens:
        # Append the parsed token to the syntax tree.

    return syntax_tree
```

### Don't use flags as function parameters

Flags tell your user that this function does more than one thing. Functions should do one thing. Split your functions if they are following different code paths based on a boolean.

**Bad:**

```python
from pathlib import Path

def create_file(name: str, temp: bool) -> None:
    if temp:
        Path('./temp/' + name).touch()
    else:
        Path(name).touch()
```

**Good:**

```python
from pathlib import Path

def create_file(name: str) -> None:
    Path(name).touch()

def create_temp_file(name: str) -> None:
    Path('./temp/' + name).touch()
```
